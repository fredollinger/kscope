/**
 * @ingroup kcmodule
 *
 * @brief Encapsulates a KCModule for embedding.
 *
 * KCModuleProxy is a wrapper for KCModule intended for cases where
 * modules are to be displayed. It ensures layout is consistent, handles
 * root/administrator modules and in general takes care of the details
 * needed for making a module available in an interface. A KCModuleProxy
 * can be treated as a QWidget, without worrying about the details specific
 * for modules such as library loading. KCModuleProxy is not a sub class of KCModule
 * but its API closely resembles KCModule's.\n
 * Usually, an instance is created by passing one of the constructors a KService::Ptr,
 * KCModuleInfo or simply the name of the module and then added to the layout as any
 * other widget. \n
 * When the user have changed the module, changed( bool ) as well as changed ( KCModuleProxy * )
 * is emitted. KCModuleProxy does not take care of prompting for saving - if the object is deleted while
 * changes is not saved the changes will be lost. changed() returns true if changes are unsaved. \n
 * \n
 * KCModuleProxy does not take care of authorization of KCModules. \n
 * KCModuleProxy do lazy loading, meaning the library will not be loaded or
 * any other initialization done before its show() function is called. This means
 * modules will only be loaded when they are actually needed as well as it is possible to
 * load many KCModuleProxy without any speed penalty.
 *
 * KCModuleProxy should be used in all cases where modules are embedded in order to
 * promote code efficiency and usability consistency.
