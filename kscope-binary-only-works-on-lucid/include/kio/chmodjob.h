     * and a general job that stats each url and returns a KFileItemList.
     *
     * Note that change of ownership is only supported for local files.
     *
     * Inside directories, the "x" bits will only be changed for files that had
     * at least one "x" bit before, and for directories.
     * This emulates the behavior of chmod +X.
     *
     * @param lstItems The file items representing several files or directories.
     * @param permissions the permissions we want to set
     * @param mask the bits we are allowed to change.
     * For instance, if mask is 0077, we don't change
     * the "user" bits, only "group" and "others".
     * @param newOwner If non-empty, the new owner for the files
     * @param newGroup If non-empty, the new group for the files
     * @param recursive whether to open directories recursively
     * @param showProgressInfo true to show progess information
