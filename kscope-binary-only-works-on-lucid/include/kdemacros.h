/**
 * The KDE_DEPRECATED macro can be used to trigger compile-time warnings
 * with newer compilers when deprecated functions are used.
 *
 * For non-inline functions, the macro gets inserted at the very end of the
 * function declaration, right before the semicolon:
 *
 * \code
 * DeprecatedConstructor() KDE_DEPRECATED;
 * void deprecatedFunctionA() KDE_DEPRECATED;
 * int deprecatedFunctionB() const KDE_DEPRECATED;
 * \endcode
 *
 * Functions which are implemented inline are handled differently: for them,
 * the KDE_DEPRECATED macro is inserted at the front, right before the return
 * type, but after "static" or "virtual":
 *
 * \code
 * KDE_DEPRECATED void deprecatedInlineFunctionA() { .. }
 * virtual KDE_DEPRECATED int deprecatedInlineFunctionB() { .. }
 * static KDE_DEPRECATED bool deprecatedInlineFunctionC() { .. }
 * \end
 *
 * You can also mark whole structs or classes as deprecated, by inserting the
 * KDE_DEPRECATED macro after the struct/class keyword, but before the
 * name of the struct/class:
 *
 * \code
 * class KDE_DEPRECATED DeprecatedClass { };
 * struct KDE_DEPRECATED DeprecatedStruct { };
 * \endcode
 *
 * \note
 * It does not make much sense to use the KDE_DEPRECATED keyword for a Qt signal;
 * this is because usually get called by the class which they belong to,
 * and one'd assume that a class author doesn't use deprecated methods of his
 * own class. The only exception to this are signals which are connected to
 * other signals; they get invoked from moc-generated code. In any case, 
 * printing a warning message in either case is not useful.
 * For slots, it can make sense (since slots can be invoked directly) but be
 * aware that if the slots get triggered by a signal, the will get called from
 * moc code as well and thus the warnings are useless.
 *
 * \par
 * Also note that it is not possible to use KDE_DEPRECATED for classes which
 * use the k_dcop keyword (to indicate a DCOP interface declaration); this is
 * because the dcopidl program would choke on the unexpected declaration
 * syntax.
