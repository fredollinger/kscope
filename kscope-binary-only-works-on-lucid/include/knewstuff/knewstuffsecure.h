/**
Makes possible downloading and installing signed resource files from a server.
You must subclass it and implement the @ref installResource() pure
virtual method to install a resource. For uploading you must create a resource
tarball (which is installabale by @ref installResource()) and call the 
@ref uploadResource() method with this tarball as the argument.
Signing and verification is done by the gpg application, so the user must
have it installed, otherwise this class does not give any extra security compared
to the standard KNewStuff class.
