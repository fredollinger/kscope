/**
 * @short Provides a means of automatically retrieving,
 * saving and resetting KConfigSkeleton based settings in a dialog.
 *
 * The KConfigDialogManager class provides a means of automatically
 * retrieving, saving and resetting basic settings.
 * It also can emit signals when settings have been changed
 * (settings were saved) or modified (the user changes a checkbox
 * from on to off).
 *
 * The names of the widgets to be managed have to correspond to the names of the
 * configuration entries in the KConfigSkeleton object plus an additional
 * "kcfg_" prefix. For example a widget named "kcfg_MyOption" would be
 * associated to the configuration entry "MyOption".
 *
 * KConfigDialogManager uses the QSqlPropertyMap class to determine if it can do
 * anything to a widget.  Note that KConfigDialogManager doesn't  require a
 * database, it simply uses the functionality that is built into the
 * QSqlPropertyMap class.  New widgets can be added to the map using
 * QSqlPropertyMap::installDefaultMap().  Note that you can't just add any
 * class.  The class must have a matching Q_PROPERTY(...) macro defined.
 *
 * For example (note that KColorButton is already added and it doesn't need to
 * manually added):
 *
 * kcolorbutton.h defines the following property:
 * \code
 * Q_PROPERTY( QColor color READ color WRITE setColor )
 * \endcode
 *
 * To add KColorButton the following code would be inserted in the main.
 *
 * \code
 * kapp->installKDEPropertyMap();
 * QSqlPropertyMap *map = QSqlPropertyMap::defaultMap();
 * map->insert("KColorButton", "color");
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you add a new widget to the QSqlPropertyMap and wish to be notified when
 * it is modified you should add its signal using addWidgetChangedSignal().
