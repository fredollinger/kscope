/**
This class is most important for application that wants to announce its service on network. 
Suppose that you want to make your web server public - this is simplest way:
 
\code
DNSSD::PublicService *service = new DNSSD::PublicService("My files","_http._tcp",80);
bool isOK = service->publish();
\endcode
 
In this example publish() is synchronous - it will not return until publishing is complete.
This is usually not too long but it can freeze application's GUI for a moment.
Asynchronous publishing is better for responsiveness. Example:
 
\code
DNSSD::PublicService *service = new DNSSD::PublicService("My files","_http._tcp",80);
connect(service,SIGNAL(published(bool)),this,SLOT(wasPublished(bool)));
service->publishAsync();
\endcode
 
 
@short This class represents local service being published
