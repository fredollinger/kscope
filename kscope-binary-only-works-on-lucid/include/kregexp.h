/**
 * @deprecated
 * Please use QRegExp instead.
 *
 * Regular expression (regexp) matching with back-references.
 *
 * This was implemented
 * because QRegExp did not support back-references. It now does and
 * is recommended over KRegExp because of the unicode support and the
 * more powerful API.
 *
 * Back-references are parts of a regexp grouped with parentheses. If a
 * string matches the regexp, you can access the text that matched each
 * group with the group method. This is similar to regular expressions 
 * in Perl.
 *
 * Example:
 * \code
 *  KRegExp ex( "([A-Za-z]+) (.+)" );
 *  ex.match( "42 Torben Weis" );
 *  kdDebug() << ex.group(0) << endl;
 *  kdDebug() << ex.group(1) << endl;
 *  kdDebug() << ex.group(2) << endl;
 * \endcode
 * Output:
 * \code
 *  Torben Weis
 *  Torben
 *  Weis
 * \endcode
 *
 * Please notice that KRegExp does @em not support unicode.
