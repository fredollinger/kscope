/**
 * Little helper class to clean up static objects that are
 * held as pointer.
 * When the library is unloaded, or the app terminated, all static deleters
 * are destroyed, which in turn destroys those static objects properly.
 * There are some rules which you should accept in the KStaticDeleter managed
 * class:
 * @li Don't rely on the global reference variable in the destructor of the 
 * object, it will be '0' at destruction time.
 * @li Don't rely on other KStaticDeleter managed objects in the destructor 
 * of the object, because it may be destroyed before your destructor get called.
 * This one can be tricky, because you might not know that you actually use a
 * KStaticDeleter managed class. So try to keep your destructor simple.
 *
 * A typical use is
 * \code
 * static KStaticDeleter<MyClass> sd;
 *
 * MyClass &MyClass::self() {
 *   if (!_self) { sd.setObject(_self, new MyClass()); }
 *   return *_self;
 * }
 * \endcode
