KScope Branch

kscope-1.6.0.orig/ is a branch of kscope maintained by Fred Ollinger (follinge@gmail.com).

http://github.com/fredollinger/kscope

It will compile against the latest KDE 3.

The ultimate plan is to add new features as well as to port to KDE 4.

If you just want the working binaries, grab kscope-binary-only-works-on-lucid/ and put it into /opt under /opt/kscope.
